# About this project

This is a simple react project that fetchs characaters from the [Rick & Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) and displays those. 

This project wasn't created using [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/), instead, I setup the compliation manually using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

I've used [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/) for the grid system.
